### Quant Trading 

This repository has some of my initial work on Quant Trading

Course material and work from two courses on Udacity ud501 and nd880.

### Framework
This will be a framework I will be using to test several hypothesis.

#### Hypothesis 1

Taking top n performing stocks and coming up with long and short positions is a terrible idea :)

```
Mean:                       -0.000118
Standard Error:             0.000101
Annualized Rate of Return:  -0.14%
```
